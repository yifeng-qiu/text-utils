# Scripts for Mundane Tasks

### BofA Statement Extractor
I was going to close my rarely used BofA checking account because I did not want to pay for the monthly maintenance fee. Before I pulled the trigger, I wanted to keep a copy of all the statements. 
While the BofA website only exports statements into csv format for the last 18 months, it does let you download all the 
statements in PDF. It would be nice to collect all the transactions into a CSV file for easy search. Hence this script was created to do exactly just that.
